Title:
"Exploratory Data Analysis of Employee Demographics Using Python"

Description:
The project entails conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on employee demographic data using Python. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, the project aims to uncover insights into various demographic factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, education, and tenure within the workforce. By exploring patterns, distributions, and correlations in the data, this analysis provides valuable insights into the composition and characteristics of the employee population.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform a thorough exploration of employee demographic data using Python's data analysis libraries. By visualizing demographic distributions, identifying trends, and conducting statistical analyses, the project aims to gain insights into the composition, diversity, and characteristics of the employee population. These insights can inform HR strategies, workforce planning, diversity initiatives, and decision-making processes within the organization.
